# Serializing rSchedule objects

Two optional packages exist for handling serializing / deserializing rSchedule objects.

- For [iCal support](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545), use the [optional `ical-tools` package](./3.%20ICAL.md).

- For standard json support, use the [optional `json-tools` package](./2.%20JSON.md).

The `json-tools` package is much smaller than the `ical-tools` package and it also supports serializing all `OccurrenceGenerator` objects (unlike `ical-tools`), so it should be your default choice.
