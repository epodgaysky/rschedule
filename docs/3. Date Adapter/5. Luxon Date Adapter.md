**[`LuxonDateAdapter extends DateAdapterBase`](./1.%20Overview.md#dateadapterbase)**

rSchedule DateAdapter for working with [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) `DateTime` objects. It has _flawed_ timezone support: Luxon has known, accepted, inconsistent behavior around time zone daylight savings time changes (see [this issue](https://github.com/moment/luxon/issues/1089) in the Luxon repo for more info). If you are using Luxon with different time zones and only displaying results in the client, it's probably fine. If you plan on serializing dates from different time zones, consider a different date library. See [this issue](https://gitlab.com/john.carroll.p/rschedule/-/issues/66) in the rSchedule repo for more info. If you need to use Luxon and you need ICAL spec compliant time zone behavior, you can create a custom date adapter that accepts Luxon `DateTime` objects as input and outputs Luxon `DateTime` objects but which delegates to a different date library under the hood (e.g. `moment-timezone` or `js-joda`) for accurate time zone behavior (see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/john.carroll.p/rschedule/-/issues/66#note_751765330) for more information as well as an example implementation).

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @rschedule/luxon-date-adapter

# or

npm install @rschedule/luxon-date-adapter
```

## Usage

`@rschedule/luxon-date-adapter` supports both Luxon v1.x and v2.x.

To use Luxon v1, configure as date adapter with:

```typescript
import '@rschedule/luxon-date-adapter/v1/setup';
```

and import the date adapter via

```ts
import { LuxonDateAdapter } from '@rschedule/luxon-date-adapter/v1';
```

To use Luxon v2, configure the date adapter with

```typescript
import '@rschedule/luxon-date-adapter/v2/setup';
```

and import the date adapter via

```ts
import { LuxonDateAdapter } from '@rschedule/luxon-date-adapter/v2';
```

For historical compatibility, you can import the v1 date adapter via

```typescript
import '@rschedule/luxon-date-adapter/setup';
```

and import the date adapter via

```ts
import { LuxonDateAdapter } from '@rschedule/luxon-date-adapter';
```

These non-versioned entry points are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. You should update your app to use either the `v1` or `v2` entry points.
