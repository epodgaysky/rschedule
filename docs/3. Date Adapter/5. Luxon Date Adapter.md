## Installation

# or

npm install @rschedule/luxon-date-adapter
```

## Usage

`@rschedule/luxon-date-adapter` supports both Luxon v1.x and v2.x.

To use Luxon v1, configure as date adapter with:

```typescript
import '@rschedule/luxon-date-adapter/v1/setup';
```

and import the date adapter via

```ts
import { LuxonDateAdapter } from '@rschedule/luxon-date-adapter/v1';
```

To use Luxon v2, configure the date adapter with

```typescript
import '@rschedule/luxon-date-adapter/v2/setup';
```

and import the date adapter via

```ts
import { LuxonDateAdapter } from '@rschedule/luxon-date-adapter/v2';
```

For historical compatibility, you can import the v1 date adapter via

```typescript
import '@rschedule/luxon-date-adapter/setup';
```

and import the date adapter via

```ts
import { LuxonDateAdapter } from '@rschedule/luxon-date-adapter';
```

These non-versioned entry points are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. You should update your app to use either the `v1` or `v2` entry points.
