**[`StandardDateAdapter extends DateAdapterBase`](./1.%20Overview.md#dateadapterbase)**

rSchedule DateAdapter for working with standard javascript `Date` objects. Only supports local and UTC timezones.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @rschedule/standard-date-adapter

# or

npm install @rschedule/standard-date-adapter
```

## Usage

Configure as date adapter with:

```typescript
import '@rschedule/standard-date-adapter/setup';
```

Unlike the other date adapters, if you want to create a StandardDateAdapter in the UTC timezone you need to pass an additional argument to the constructor

Example

```typescript
new StandardDateAdapter(new Date(), { timezone: 'UTC' });
```

Additionally, many object methods in rSchedule can accept either a raw date (in this case `Date`) object, or a DateAdapter object. If you ever want to specify that the date you are passing is a UTC date, you need to pass a StandardDateAdapter instance. This is because Date objects don't have a timezone setting themselves.

An example of where this is needed is if you are creating a new rule and the start time should be in UTC. In that case, you would need to pass in a `StandardDateAdapter` object as the start time, rather than a `Date` as the start time.
